# ABOUT

Wolf is already pretty cool. I wanted to make him cooler. The main focus is his special moves, all of which will be rekitted with new functionility giving wolf new options, albeit mainly once already in advantage state. He's also got the typical jump cancel shine as well as some blaster buffs as expected, being the true token spacie rep for this mod
