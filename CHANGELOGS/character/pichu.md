# ABOUT

My idea for pichu was to have a fighter with a burst movement option that was heavily incorperated into their moveset, without being obnoxious, sort of like quick attack cancelling in previous games, while also maintaining the essence of Ultimate Pichu, being a stylish glass canon. He's also larger now, aligning him and his disadvantage slightly better with the rest of the cast

# NEW MECHANICS

- Dair cancelling
- Hitfall up air

# CHANGELOG

- General
    - Model scale ~0.9 -> 1.015 [=]

- Up air
    - Late hit now sends slightly downwards like melee pikachu

- Up special
    - Sends in the direction of pichus movement slightly, has some late % combos


# IN PROGRESS
